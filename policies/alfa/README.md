# Overview

This is the home for ALFA-generated policies. It contains
- Attribute definitions [standard OASIS](standard-attributes.alfa) (autogenerated by VSCode plugin) and [FABRIC-specific](fabric-attributes.alfa). Some ALFA standard [definitions](system.alfa) (also auto-generated by VSCode plugin).
- Directories for different policy implementations:
    - [Test policies](TestPolicies)
    - [Simple always 'yes'](FabricAlwaysYes) - usable by an AM or a Broker in a simple federation where most policies are enforced by the Orchestrator
    - [Simple always 'no'](FabricAlwaysNo) - useful for testing for what happens when things are denied
    - [Project-tag based Orchestrator policy](FabricOrchestratorProjectTags)
- Common requests are located in [Requests](Requests). The structure of requests is described [here](Requests/README.md).
